The Library System is an interactive console-based application that allows users to explore information about books in a library. The program displays a menu with options to view details of five different books. Users can continue exploring or exit the system as desired.

The system currently supports up to five books, but it can be easily expanded by adding new book variables and menu options.
Acknowledgment
This project is developed for educational purposes and demonstrates a basic library management system in Python. It can be enhanced with additional features like saving user interactions, storing data in files, or using a graphical interface.
